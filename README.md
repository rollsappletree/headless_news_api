# Tecnologies
## Api Platform
> This project uses [Api Platform](https://api-platform.com/) as it's base component. 
> 
> API Platform is a set of tools to build and consume web APIs that relies on Symfony Framework.
## Docker
> This project ships with a complete-working-out-of-the-box environment made with Docker.
> It consist of: 
> * PHP 8.0.3 fpm with Composer2, OpCache, ACPU and Xdebug already configured.
> * [Caddy web server](https://caddyserver.com/) with the [Mercure](https://api-platform.com/docs/core/mercure/) (real-time and async) and [Vulcain](https://vulcain.rocks/) (relations preloading) modules
> * Postgres DB
> 
> You can override the configuration (mainly ports etc) by modifying `docker-compose.override.yml` conf file.

## Install
The main part of this project is no the `api` directory. So switch to `api` and install all the stuff:
```sh
cd api
make first_run
```
This command will:
* Prepare Docker environment
* Start the container
* Prepare all the ssl certificates for JWT to work
* Create the DB and all the tables
* Load the fixtures

Then go to [https://localhost](https://localhost) and accept the self signed certificate. You will be prompted with the default API Platform page. 

Go to [https://localhost/docs](https://localhost/docs) for the OpenApi docs

nb: all the makefile scripts are in `api` directory
## Run tests
